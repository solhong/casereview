# Differences in the Rookie Animation Elements between Taiwan and Japan: A Case Study of College Student Groups with Different Lifestyles 


## Summary of the paper
This study is to understand the differences between college students with different lifestyles in terms of evaluating rookie animation elements in Taiwan and Japan. 
The rookie animation is created by students who received animation education.

To find out a significant difference in the animation preference, One-Way ANOVA analysis is performed. Moreover, the study adopts a multivariate statistical analysis and the statistical results reveal that 4 animation elements have statistical significant differences. These are story, character, dynamics, and storyboard. Based on the statistical results, participants with different lifestyles shows a different evaluation of animation elements.

The participants are college students, who likes selected 10 animation, and they answered the lifestyle questionnaire and the animation evaluation after seeing the animation one by one in 2 hours. With regard to lifestyle, components from 16 Activity Interest Opinion(AIO) questions reduced to four components, including planning, fashion, learning, and animation through factor analysis. There are 7 elements to evaluate the animation, story, style, character, scenario, dynamics, storyboard, and sound. 

## 1) What did the authors try to examine using the analysis of variance?
To find a significant difference in the evaluation of different rookie animation elements among different groups with different lifestyles, One-Way ANOVA analysis is used. 
*rookie animation refers to the animation works created by students who have received the necessary animation education and just graduated from school. 

## 2) How many levels did the independent variable have? Identify the levels.
The independent variable has 7 levels. There are 7 animation elements including story, style, character, scenario, dynamics, storyboard, and sound. 

The animation elements, independent variables, are collected from the literature reviews. From literature review, Pixar Animation Studios shows that successful animation has 3 elements: plot, pictures, and sound. Chen & Hsu’ study on the appealing factors of flash animation with applying the Evaluation Grid Method. 80 participants answered the questionnaires that can be accessed with the Internet. The data indicates that the main factors of flash animation are story or plot, character shaping, scene visual style, sound and color application.


## 2) How was the dependent variable measured?
After referencing the other related lifestyle questionnaires, the experts chose 16 items that are suitable for the lifestyle questionnaire that was used in this study. Through the item analysis, this study deleted 3 items so that a total 13 lifestyle items are shown Table 2. 

To measure the degree of preference for 13 lifestyle items, the seven-order Likert scale method is used.

To analyze the lifestyle items, a factor analysis is used to reduce the factor dimensions of 13 lifestyle questions and keep 4 factors whose characteristic values are bigger than 1. With the acquired four lifestyle factor analysis, K-mean cluster analysis is used. There are significant differences on each component in four groups using the F-test. This study divides and labeled the college students into 4 groups. Group 1 is labeled as “Cool Boys” and this group shows more importance on planning and fashion components have a certain amount of interest and attention on animation elements. Group 2 is labeled as “Indoor Boys” and this group represents a higher importance on animation elements. Group 3 is labeled as “Bookworm” and this group lays emphasis on learning components.Group 4 is labeled as “Fashionable Boys” and this group gives importance on fashion. 

To find whether the clustering effects of K-mean cluster analysis are good and stable, Post-hoc test is performed and the result is shown in “5)”.



## 3) Was it a within-group test? In other words, was the test a repeated measure?
Yes. It was a within-group test. The respondents of this study are college students of 10 rookie animation groups from Taiwan and Japan. They are first invited to answer the lifestyle questionnaire and the animation evaluation after seeing the animated works. Animated works are shown one by one. The whole activity takes about two hours. 29 valid questionnaires returned. 

## 4)Does the statistical result support or reject the authors’ hypothesis?

Yes. The results of statistical analysis show that there are differences in the evaluation of animation elements from different college groups with different lifestyles. 

The story, character, dynamics, and storyboard are the strengths of Taiwanese rookie animations. However, Taiwan(5.42) had lower evaluation on style in animation than Japan(5.63). Therefore, Taiwanese animation education needs to strengthen the style element. This results are shown in Table 6.

In order to find the differences on the evaluation of animation elements of rookie animation between Taiwan and Japan, T-test and Post-hoc test is used. The result is that there is a higher evaluation on the style of Japanese rookie animation than Taiwanese, while Taiwanese rookie animation outperforms in the other elements. Also, there are significant differences between these works with regard to story(f=8.90), character(f=4.02), dynamic(8.56), and storyboard(5.73). These results are shown in Table 6.

Additionally, Two-way ANOVA is conducted to identify the differences in the evaluation of rookie animation elements based on different ethnic groups from Taiwan and Japan. There are differences in the evaluation of style and characters in different groups from Taiwan and Japan. Fashionable boys(Group 4) lays great emphasis on style of rookie animation from Taiwan than Japan. Cool boys(Group 1) gives higher evaluation on characters in rookie animation from Japan than Taiwan. These results are shown in Table 7.

## 5)Was a Post-hoc test used?
If yes, what kind of it? What was additionally obtained from the Post-hoc test?

Yes. Post-hoc test is conducted to examine if there is a statistically significant difference in the six lifestyle components. Through the results, there is a significant difference in all components between these four groups . The results are shown in Table. 5

In order to find the differences on the evaluation of animation elements of rookie animation between Taiwan and Japan, T-test and Post-hoc test is used. The result is that there is a higher evaluation on the style of Japanese rookie animation than Taiwanese, while Taiwanese rookie animation outperforms in the other elements. Also, there are significant differences between these works with regard to story(f=8.90), character(f=4.02), dynamic(8.56), and storyboard(5.73). These results are shown in Table 6.

To obtain the significant differences on evaluation of animation elements of rookie animation among different groups, One-way ANOVA analysis and post-hoc test is performed . In the results, shown in Table 6, there are significant differences between three styles(f=3.01), dynamic(f=3.41), and storyboard(f=6.68).

## Conclusion

The analysis supports that there are significant differences in the evaluation of animation elements from college students with different lifestyles. The aspects of story, character, dynamics and storyboard have a higher evaluation in rookie animations from Taiwan than Japan. Japan had higher evaluation on the aspect of style. Cool boys(group 1) lay higher evaluation on all components of rookie animation, whereas indoor boys(group2) show lowest evaluation on all elements.
