# Analysis on the Overall Level of Regional Innovation Environment in China, Zhang, Y., & Hu, P. (2018)

## Summary
The research focuses on finding the main influencing factors of the regional innovation environment and examines the regional innovation environment level of all provinces in China. To evaluate and analyze the differences and rationale of the regional innovation environment of 31 provinces in China, the study sets up an evaluation index system of regional innovation environment from the Economic basic environment, industrial structure, market development degree, R & D basic environment and Provincial government policies support. The data of the characteristics of the region, the level of economic development, regional science and technology funding, personnel input, the level of scientific and technological development are collected from the China statistical yearbook. The website of the national bureau of statistics and manual sorting are also used to obtain the data. Based on the previous research results and literature reviews, the regional innovation environment consists of 5 primary variables and eight secondary variables, shown in Table 1. To observe a big difference between different regions in varied variables, descriptive statistics are used. After that, the factor analysis is performed to reduce the multi-level evaluation index dimension to two dimensions, the main influencing factors. According to the extracted two factors, the paper generates cluster analysis to cluster them. 

## 1) What was the purpose for the author(s) to use the factor analysis in the study?  
	Besides, the factor is one of the objective evaluations for evaluating regional innovation and commonly used from the relevant research study. Therefore, this paper decided to use factor analysis to overcome subjective randomness. Also, by performing the factor analysis, the dimensions of the multi-level evaluation index can be reduced to the fewer comprehensive indexes. Also, the factor analysis is conducted to extract the main influencing factors of the regional innovation environment. 
To know the sample data are useful for factor analysis, a correlation analysis of variables is performed. The results, shown in Table 3, reveal that the correlation between variables is large enough to conduct the factor analysis. Based on the result, KMO is 0.78, which is close to 1.0 and high value. Thus, the factor analysis is useful with this data. Bartlett’s spherical test value is 223.63 (p <0.00), which is less than 0.05 and a small value of the significance level. The factor analysis is suitable. (shown in Table 5.)

## 2) How many items were included for the factor analysis? 
8 items were included for the factor analysis. And these 8 items are organized from the basis of existing research on the regional innovation environment.

## 3) What kind of rotation was used? Was it an orthogonal analysis? 
Yes. Orthogonal rotation is used and the results, Table 6, shown as rotating the component matrix. 
With the results, two factors, F1 and F2 are generated: 
F1 = 0.926X1 + 0.488X2 -0.724X3 +0.833X4 + 0.276X5 + 0.908X6 + 0.717X7 -0.120X8 
F2 = 0.249X1 + 0.638X2 + 0.115X3 +0.408X4 + 0.897X5 + 0.160X6 + 0.586X7 +0.902X8 
X1(GDP)、X3(GEV)、X4(FI)、X6(Univnum) and X7(EF) load highly on the factor 1, 
whereas X2(HTV/IV), X5(R&D) and X8(GFEST/ GDP) load highly on factor 2.

## 4) How many factors were extracted? 
Two factors with eigenvalues larger than 1 were extracted (79.748 % of the total variance could be explained). This is additionally explained in Figure 1.

## 5) How was each labeled (named)?  
The 8 factors are labeled as Area GDP, Percentage of high-tech industrial output value, Output value of state owned holding industrial enterprises, Total investment of foreign-funded enterprises, Research and development funds, Number of universities, University R & D expenditure, the proportion of government fiscal expenditure.

## Conclusion
The study finds out the main influencing factors of the innovation environment level in a wide range of the regions of China. The results show that differences in the number of universities, investment of foreign-funded enterprises, and university R & D expenditure are the main factors that cause unbalanced distribution and larger differences overall in the country. The economic development in the eastern region is better than the western region because of the high innovative resources in the eastern region. On the basis of the results, the future suggestions for innovation balance between the regions are emphasis on the even distribution of the innovative resource, support the central and western regions to build a better innovative environment, and consideration for each different characteristics of innovation environment development.
